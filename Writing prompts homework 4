Callback Functions

This ia a function that is used in another function as its parameter, which is 
then later called and used inside the first function.  Unlike a function, the 
callback function is  not executed immediately since it is inside a function, but 
can be "called back" or executed at some specified point inside the function that 
it is contained in.


Closure

A closure is a function that is able to reference another local variable of 
another function.  Usually, a local variable can only be called inside the 
function that is declared in, but a closure function is able to call this local 
variable in another function.


arguments

Arguments are special variables in a function whenever the function is called. It 
refers to an object that holds all the arguments passed to the function.


Recursion

Recursion is a function that can call itself inside its own function.  It does so
by using its function name within its own function.


prototype

A prototype object is an object with properties and methods from which other 
objects inherit its properties from.  All function and objects have an inherent 
prototype object from which all other objects borrow their properties and methods 
from.


Constructors

A constructor function is a function used for initializing new objects, and you 
use the new object keyword to call the constructor.
